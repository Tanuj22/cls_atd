To get cosine similarity between feature vectors:

1. Place the '.feat' files to be tested in the 'day' folder. Each '.feat' file represents one face.
2. Place the standard '.feat' files in 'standard_features' folder. Each '.feat' file here represents the standard faces to match against.
3. Run cossim.py to get the which face among the standard ones does each face in 'day' folder match best to.
